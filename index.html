            <h2>About Us</h2>
            
                <p>Our two-part rescue mission at Arctic Fox Daily:

<ol>
    <li><i>Provide forever sanctuary to captive-bred unwanted, neglected, abandoned, non-releasable wildlife, specializing in 
    foxes and wolfdogs.</i></li>

    <li><i>Practice wildlife rehabilitation: We rescue, raise, and release orphaned, New York-native wildlife. The end goal of 
    wildlife rehabilitation is always to allow the animal to take its place back in nature.</i></li>

</ol>

<br><q>Hi everyone, my name's Kimberly. My family and I live in Upstate New York, which is where I run my home-based wild
    life rescue. I've been volunteering my time working with and raising rescued wildlife and exotic pets since 2012. I possess both 
    federal USDA and NYS DEC licenses, which allow me to legally work with these animals. In 2020, my rescue efforts had 
    grown enough that I decided to take the leap to found a nonprofit, and that's when Arctic Fox Daily Wildlife Rescue 
    Inc. was born.</q>


<p>All of our non-releasable permanent residents were either born in captivity - not taken from the wild - or have a 
    permanent disability that would prevent them from surviving and thriving in the wild. We love sharing a look into 
    the behaviors and lives of these beautiful animals, enjoy helping people learn about the realities of exotic pet 
    ownership (foxes really don't make good pets), and enjoy furthering conservation efforts through education.</p>
    
<p>Rescuing these animals is time-consuming, many times heartbreaking, but most of all - it's incredibly rewarding! 
    The feeling associated with A) being able to provide forever sanctuary to an animal who'd otherwise have been 
    euthanized and B) opening up an enclosure door and allowing a rehabilitated animal to take its place back in nature 
    is so unique and special. </p>
    
<p>We are personally responsible for all costs associated with our rescue efforts, and receive no funding from the government. 
    We rely on donations, grants, gifts from our wish list, or money out of our own pockets. No contribution 
    is ever too small - thank you for your support!</p>
